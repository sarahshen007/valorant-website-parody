  <!--Right now, these offers don't actually take you to a store. I opted instead to take you to the credit purchase
section, as a default for those with 0 credits in their account balance.
Blank spaces in each separate skin offer box are 
meant to have a transparent png image of the skin. I just don't have those pictures haha-->
