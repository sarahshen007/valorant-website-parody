# valorant-website-parody
This is just a short website I did over the course of two days, based on one of my favorite FPS games, Valorant.
It makes heavy use of :hover and the transition property to make the website seem more interactive. There is a bit of JavaScript, however,
used to create functioning countdown sections for the "Offers" section of the website.
